Modularity shapes the quality of information systems, software, and system
production processes. Modularity influences system diversity, dependability,
performance, evolution, the structure and the dynamics of the organizations
that produce systems, human understanding and management of systems, and
ultimately system value.

Yet the nature of and possibilities for modularity remain poorly understood,
such things as the limits to modularity, the mechanisms needed to achieve it in
given forms, and its costs and benefits. Significant advances in modularity are
possible and promise to yield breakthroughs in our ability to conceive, design,
develop, validate, integrate, deploy, operate, and evolve modern information
systems and their underlying software artifacts.

Modularity at the semantic as well as the syntactic level is a key enabler for
the expression of high quality software systems. One of the most important
techniques for complexity management during the creation of software is
abstraction. Novel concepts and abstraction mechanisms are a focus point for
improvements in the support for modularity.

The scope of this event covers all perspectives on software systems in all
their life-cycle phases.
