<h2>What To Do When Things Go Wrong: Recovery in Complex (Computer) Systems
<div style="font-size:smaller;">[Keynote and Heart-of-Technology Lecture]</div>
<div style="font-size:smaller;">Chair: Richard P. Gabriel</div>
</h2>
<div class="author">by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/">Martin C. Rinard</a></div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>We present and analyze a range of techniques for recovering from faults in complex hardware and software systems, from classical techniques that attempt to preserve the abstraction of perfection in the presence of faults to emerging techniques that adapt application functionality to transcend faults, overcome implementation errors in both the hardware and software, and adapt to the characteristics of the underlying execution environment.</div>

<h2>A tour of the Data-Context-Interaction Paradigm<div style="font-size:smaller;">[Heart-of-Technology Lecture]</div>
<div style="font-size:smaller;">Chair: Shigeru Chiba</div>
</h2>
<div>by <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/gertrudandcope.com/www/jimcoplien">Jim Coplien</a></div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
Most programming today is based on class-based development, and while it enables the programmer in the short term it represents only a half-step into the mental model of the end user. What's worse is that it fails to account for the long-term action in program evolution, which may be based more on what procedures do well than what classes do. DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) is an integrated worldview of programs and their people that unifies the erstwhile “what-the-system-is” world of classes with the “what-the-system-does” world of processes. It is an object model that captures the mental models of programmers and users alike. This lecture is a practical introduction to DCI. It will lay a brief foundation in class-based programming and domain analysis, and advance into techniques based on role modeling and implementing use cases within dynamic run-time components called Contexts.

<h2>Objects of the people, for the people, and by the people
<div style="font-size:smaller;">[Keynote]</div>
<div style="font-size:smaller;">Chair: Kevin Sullivan</div>
</h2>
<div class="author">by <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/gertrudandcope.com/www/jimcoplien">Jim Coplien</a></div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>Computers were invented largely as mental aids. In inventing object-orientation, Alan Kay renewed that vision on a metaphorical level that no longer subordinated computers to human minds. Trygve Reenskaug tried to link the worlds of the human and the computer together with Model-View-Controller, but at the time he got only half the job done. Today we're stuck in this Kantian object world where individual objects act alone and programmers live inside of classes looking out: there is rarely any sense of collective behavior in object-oriented systems, and there is rarely any degree of behavioral (self-)organization.

I have been working with Trygve on a paradigm called DCI that places the human experiences of design and use of programs equally at center stage. It balances the object interaction view with the traditional data conceptualization of class-oriented programming. DCI offers a vision of computers and people being mutually alive in Christopher Alexander's sense of great design. It serves Englebart's original vision of object-orientation powering computers as mental adjuncts, as well as Kay's vision as objects as a recursion on the concept of a computer. In this world with a rapidly growing number of increasingly connected human minds, DCI opens up a playful dialogue contrasting metaphors of collective human reasoning and Kay's vision of object computation.

</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Underlying the work on Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) there is a premise that no one ever challenged: the existence of cross-cutting concerns that find their way to programs in a tangled and scattered manner. We’ve all seen it. But do tangling and scattering of program concerns really exist in real programs? Do they have a strong effect or is this one of those academic non-issues? That was the question we set out to answer in a paper we published at OOPSLA 2008. And the answer was: yes, these effects do exist in real programs, they are noticeable and detect- able, and they reveal a few insights on the nature of those concerns. But they raise even more questions for AOP. I will talk about this study and its consequences.

<h2>Implementing Language Based Virtual Machines
<div style="font-size:smaller;">[Keynote and Heart-of-Technology Lecture]</div>
<div style="font-size:smaller;">Chair: Éric Tanter</div>
</h2>
<div class="author">by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_(computer_programmer)">Lars Bak</a></div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Craftsmanship, innovation, competition, and stubbornness are all ingredients for pushing the envelope of virtual machines.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 25 years striving to perfect the art of creating such systems. A few of them even had real impact: Hotspot for Java and V8 for JavaScript. This talk will highlight both technical and non-technical aspects of taking an idea, building a team around it, and then developing a product. Rest assured, the majority of this presentation will focus on interpreters, compilers, garbage collectors, and performance.</p>
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p><img src="../images/stories/bak.jpg" alt="" class="social-event-imagery" />Lars Bak is a veteran virtual machinist. His passion for designing and implementing object-oriented virtual machines has left marks on several software systems: Beta, Self, Strongtalk, Sun's HotSpot and CLDC HI, OOVM Smalltalk, and V8. Since joining Google in the fall of 2006, Lars has been responsible for the design and implementation of V8. He graduated from Aarhus University in 1988 with a MS degree in computer science.</p>
