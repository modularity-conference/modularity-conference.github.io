received a Ph.D. from the University of Magdeburg, Germany, in 2002
for his research on the combination of aspect-orientation and
product-line concepts for the construction of embedded operating
system families. An important part of this work was the design of the
AspectC++ language, which he started in 2001. AspectC++ is an
aspect-oriented language extension for C++ in the style of AspectJ.
Today he is the main designer and developer of the AspectC++ weaver,
which he presented at various AOSD and OOPSLA demonstrations and
tutorials. His current research is focused on the combination of
generic and generative programming with AOP in AspectC++, and on
applying these techniques in the implementation of the CiAO operating
system family. In 2002 he started to cooperate with pure-systems GmbH,
Magdeburg, Germany, to speed up the AspectC++ tool development and to
evolve it from a research prototype to commercial-quality software.
