### About Modularity

Modularity shapes the quality of information systems, software, and system
production processes. Modularity influences system diversity, dependability,
performance, evolution, the structure and the dynamics of the organizations
that produce systems, human understanding and management of systems, and
ultimately system value.

Yet the nature of and possibilities for modularity remain poorly understood,
such things as the limits to modularity, the mechanisms needed to achieve it in
given forms, and its costs and benefits. Significant advances in modularity are
possible and promise to yield breakthroughs in our ability to conceive, design,
develop, validate, integrate, deploy, operate, and evolve modern information
systems and their underlying software artifacts.

Modularity at the semantic as well as the syntactic level is a key enabler for
the expression of high quality software systems. One of the most important
techniques for complexity management during the creation of software is
abstraction. Novel concepts and abstraction mechanisms are a focus point for
improvements in the support for modularity. The scope of this conference covers
all perspectives on software systems in all their life-cycle phases, such as
the following:

 * domain analysis
 * case studies on modularity or the lack thereof
 * programming language constructs
 * runtime environments and library support
 * formal proofs of system properties
 * program state visualization in debuggers
 * performance improvements in compiler algorithms

The 2016 edition of the Modularity conference (formerly known as AOSD) sets out
to advance our understanding of these issues and the expressive power of new
and known techniques.


### Research Results and Modularity Visions

Modularity 2016 invites papers for its Research Results and Modularity Visions
tracks presenting compelling insights into modularity in information systems,
including its nature, forms, mechanisms, consequences, limits, costs, and
benefits.

Proceedings will appear in the ACM Digital Library.

All submissions are peer reviewed in accordance with the highest established
standards of scientific rigor. Reviewers assess works in terms of research
problem formulations, novelty and sophistication of proposed solutions, clarity
and significance of contributions, and correct characterization of work in
relation to existing knowledge.

Papers submitted to the **Research Results** track should present research
results supported by proper design and execution of experimental or analytical
assessments and sound interpretation of data.

Papers submitted to the **Modularity Visions** track are examined
as scientific research proposals discussing compelling
preliminary results or worked-out prototypes or proposals for sound
future experimental or analytical assessments and interpretation
of data.
<!-- The use of worked-out prototypes to support new
ideas is strongly encouraged. -->
The scope of Modularity Visions is broad and open to submissions from all areas
of computer science.

### Submissions, Selection Process, and Proceedings

Submissions should not have been published previously nor under review at other
events. Research papers should describe work that advances the current state of
the art. Experience papers should be of broad interest and should describe
insights gained from substantive practical applications. The program committee
will evaluate each contributed paper based on its relevance, significance,
clarity, length, and originality.

Papers are to be submitted electronically at
<http://cyberchairpro.borbala.net/modularitypapers/submit/> for Research
Results and <http://cyberchairpro.borbala.net/modularityvisionspapers/submit/>
for Modularity Visions in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM format
(see <http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/>, 10 point font) and not exceed
12 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers. Short papers need to
be labelled as such.

_Note:_ In previous years, the conference had two rounds of submissions and
reviews. Starting this year, Modularity 2016 will run a **single-round** two-phase
reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they
can be. After the first phase, papers will be rejected, conditionally accepted,
or unconditionally accepted. Conditionally accepted papers will be given a list
of issues raised by reviewers. Authors must then submit a revised version of
the paper with a cover letter explaining how they have or why they have not
addressed these issues. The program committee will then consider the cover letter and
revised paper, and recommend final acceptance or rejection. The second phase
will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference standard, not
to require additional work of papers already deemed up to standard. All papers
will remain under submission until the authors receive notification of
acceptance or rejection.

All submitted papers are peer reviewed. Accepted papers will be published in
the ACM Digital Library.
